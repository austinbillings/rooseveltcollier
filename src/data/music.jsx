        <p>Andy Hall of The Infamous Stringdusters and Roosevelt Collier of the Lee Boys have come together on a new album, Let The Steel Play, which is set for independent release June 16, 2017. Let the Steel Play was born out of a love of slide guitar, and a friendship made through music. Andy Hall and Roosevelt Collier met in 2012 on Jam Cruise, and began playing music together when their paths would cross. Both are sought after sit-in players at festivals throughout the country and known for their dexterity, versatility, and intuitive knack for picking up rhythms and melodies.</p>

        <p>Coming from different backgrounds and methods, yet brought together through slide guitar, Roosevelt and Andy have joined forces to create a musical bridge that emanates a freshness, yet honors both traditions.</p>

        <p>Featuring <b>Roosevelt Collier</b> on Lap Steel guitar, the band’s debut goes from Zeppelin-esque blues stomp to folkloric Caribbean kaladja over the course its ten tracks, blending the extensive and varied knowledge of the individual players with a strong, yet empathetic, lyrical approach. Through it all, Bokanté is a vibrant image of what it wishes to see in the world: connection, unity, and love- through exchange.</p>
